# Studious Transport

An application to help students be productive in and out of commute! Built for students, by students!

Many students in North America spend hours commuting to their university every day. As a student myself, I feel a bit aggrieved that I can't spend that time effectively. I tried to listen to lectures but that was a hassle, and reading a textbook on your phone is a pain. But what if there was an alternative?
